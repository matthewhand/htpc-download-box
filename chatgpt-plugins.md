# ChatGPT and Plugins Workflow

This workflow describes the interaction between the user, ChatGPT, and various plugins and services.

1. The user instructs ChatGPT to perform a task.
2. ChatGPT uses the ChatSshPlug plugin to access the alias master server.
3. The alias master server can use SSH to access the worker1 and worker2 servers.
4. Alternatively, ChatGPT can use the Noteable Python Notebook to run scripts.
5. The Python Notebook can use the boto3 library and environment variables to access AWS services.
6. AWS can use the SSM Agent to access the alias master server.

This workflow allows ChatGPT to control and manage a network of servers through various methods.
